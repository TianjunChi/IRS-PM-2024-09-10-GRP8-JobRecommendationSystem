## Introduction
Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) is a new recommendation framework tailored to knowledge-aware personalized recommendation. Built upon the graph neural network framework, KGAT explicitly models the high-order relations in collaborative knowledge graph to provide better recommendation with item side information.


## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.10. The required packages are as follows:
* torch == 1.6.0
* numpy == 1.21.4
* pandas == 1.3.5
* scipy == 1.5.2
* tqdm == 4.62.3
* scikit-learn == 1.0.1

## Run the Codes
* KGAT
```
python main_kgat.py --data_name amazon-book
```
        
* `train.txt`
  * Train file.
  * Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: (`userID` and `a list of itemID`).
  
* `test.txt`
  * Test file (positive instances).
  * Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: (`userID` and `a list of itemID`).
  * Note that here we treat all unobserved interactions as the negative instances when reporting performance.
  
* `user_list.txt`
  * User file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`org_id`, `remap_id`) for one user, where `org_id` and `remap_id` represent the ID of such user in the original and our datasets, respectively.
  
* `item_list.txt`
  * Item file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`org_id`, `remap_id`, `freebase_id`) for one item, where `org_id`, `remap_id`, and `freebase_id` represent the ID of such item in the original, our datasets, and freebase, respectively.
  
* `entity_list.txt`
  * Entity file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`freebase_id`, `remap_id`) for one entity in knowledge graph, where `freebase_id` and `remap_id` represent the ID of such entity in freebase and our datasets, respectively.
  
* `relation_list.txt`
  * Relation file.
  * Each line is a triplet (`freebase_id`, `remap_id`) for one relation in knowledge graph, where `freebase_id` and `remap_id` represent the ID of such relation in freebase and our datasets, respectively.
